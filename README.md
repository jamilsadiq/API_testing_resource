# API_testing_resource

I've prepared Demo API Test Plan, Test Case and Bug report for the Fake Rest API, which is hosted at https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/index.html


ðŸŽ¯ The objective of Test plan, Test cases and Bug report is to systematically evaluate the software's functionality, reliability, and performance to ensure it meets requirements, complies with standards, and delivers a high-quality user experience.

ðŸ“Œ Those seeking guidance on API testing documentation can refer to or utilize this demo for their projects.
